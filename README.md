# Kaizer

Kaizer is a VS Code Extension inspired by MS Word's Clippy. There are four characters planned - **Pengu**, *Kathy*, *Dobby* and *Pandora*, each having a unique personality.

We wanted to make something that would be a small stress reliever for us hackers. 

Maybe to help clear your mind or if you're stuck somewhere, hangout with Kaizer to freshen up those braincells. Take care of these buddies like they were your own pet.
